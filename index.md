I am an **applied data scientist** with a focus in education and policy. My background is in STEM education and law, and I graduated magna cum laude in 2021 with a B.S. in Microbial Biology and a B.A. in Media Studies, also from the University of California, Berkeley.

I am looking for Summer 2022 internship roles in data science or data analytics. If you think I'd be a good fit for your organization, you can reach out to me at **[castro.ian(at)berkeley.edu](mailto:castro.ian@berkeley.edu)** or through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-k-castro/).

## About me

I am a first-generation Filipino college student born and raised in the East Bay Area. Growing up in a community heavily shaped by the big tech industry, I saw how STEM degrees- particularly computer and data science- have great possibilities for social mobility, but access to these STEM fields is particularly limited for students who are low-income, first-generation, or underrepresented. Most of my professional experience has been as an educator in this space, aiming to make introductory courses more accessible to build interest in these fields.

I am skilled at statistical analysis (research design, hypothesis testing, regression analysis), programming (Python and R), and data science (exploratory data analysis, data visualization, natural language processing, and applied machine learning). I also have a strong background in communication, consitutional law, and policy research. You can see some of work I've done in the sections below.

My broad interests can be distilled into the three following areas:

1. Data science as a tool for social good
1. Accessibility in data and computer science education
1. Information policy (privacy, freedom of speech, and freedom of press)

Currently, I am a data science fellow at the UC Berkeley Social Sciences Data Lab([D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/), a graduate student instructor in the department of Psychology, and a [CalNERDS](https://calnerds.berkeley.edu/) affiliate studying diversity in STEM. In the past, I have interned at the Internet Education Foundation for the [Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/) and taught at the UC Berkeley [Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/).

Outside of school, I'm interested in mycology, live music, and making drinks (both caffeinated and not).

If you're interested in applying to graduate school, or speaking with me about any of these interests, let me know!
