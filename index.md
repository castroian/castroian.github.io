I am an applied data scientist with a focus in education and policy. My background is in STEM education and law, and I graduated in 2021 with a B.S. in Microbial Biology and a B.A. in Media Studies, also from the University of California, Berkeley.

I am currently looking for Summer 2022 internship roles in data science or data analytics. If you think I'd be a good fit for your organization, you can reach out to me at [castro.ian(at)berkeley.edu](castro.ian@berkeley.edu) or through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-k-castro/).
