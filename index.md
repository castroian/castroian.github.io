I am an **applied data scientist** üìà with a focus in education and policy. My background is in STEM education and information law, and I graduated magna cum laude in 2021 with a B.S. in Microbial Biology and a B.A. in Media Studies, also from the University of California, Berkeley üêª.

I finish my graduate program in Spring 2023 and will be looking for full-time positions then. If you think I'd be a good fit for your organization, please reach out to me at [castro.ian(at)berkeley.edu](mailto:castro.ian@berkeley.edu) or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-k-castro/).

## About me üëã

I am a first-generation Filipino üáµüá≠ graduate student born and raised in the East Bay Area. Growing up in a community significantly shaped by the big tech industry, I saw how STEM degrees- particularly computer and data science- offer great possibilities for social mobility, but access to these  fields is particularly limited for students who are low-income, first-generation, or generally underrepresented. Most of my professional experience has been as an educator in this space, motivated by my own lack of access to STEM opportunities growing up and my struggles to find a community in the field. Since coming to Cal, I have worked to make key introductory courses more accessible for marginalized students and non-majors to help build interest in CS/DS while also emphasizing the social impact of data and technology.

I am skilled at statistical analysis (research design, hypothesis testing, regression analysis), programming (algorithms and data structures in Python and R), and data science (exploratory data analysis, data visualization, natural language processing, and applied machine learning). I also have a strong background in communication, constitutional law, and policy research. You can see some of work I've done in the sections below.

My broad interests can be distilled into the three following areas:

1. Data science as a tool for social good üìä
1. Accessibility in data & computer science education üíª
1. Information law & policy (privacy, freedom of speech, and freedom of press) ‚öñÔ∏è

In terms of research, I study issues regarding equity in communities. This summer, I am working at [PolicyLink](https://www.policylink.org/) on their [National Equity Atlas](https://www.policylink.org/our-work/economy/national-equity-atlas) project. In Fall 2022, I will work with Dr. Tim Thomas on the [Evictions Project](https://evictions.study/), studying gentrification and demographic disparities in evictions.

Here are some of my past affiliations:

- Fellow at the UC Berkeley Social Sciences Data Lab ([D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/))
- Student Director at [CalNERDS](https://calnerds.berkeley.edu/)
- Intern at Internet Education Foundation's [Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/)
- Coordinator for an [overnight scholarship recruiting program](https://rohp.berkeley.edu/) with the UC Berkeley Financial Aid & Scholarships Office
- Instructor at UC Berkeley [Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/)

Outside of school, I'm interested in mycology, baseball (Go A's!), art (live music and photography) and making drinks (both caffeinated and not). A fun fact about me is that, after drinking tea for the past decade, I've probably tasted over 300 different teas total from every continent where tea plants can grow. You can often find me at [Blue Willow Tea](https://www.bluewillowtea.com/); I highly recommend it!

Lastly, if you're interested in applying to graduate school, or speaking with me about any of these interests, let me know! I love to speak with students and other people studying these fields.
